						<p>	Leonila Hill Barangay was originally called Sunrise Subdivision that was later acquired by the Government Insurance Service System (GSIS) during the term of President Carlos P.
							Garcia. Subsequently, the subdivision was renamed Leonila Hill Subdivision after the name of First Lady Leonila Garcia.</p>

						<p>	After the City was divided into different barangay, the upper part of Leonila hill Subdivision became West Bayan Park Barangay since it is located West of Bayan Park Village. 
							Lower portion of the subdivision became North SAnitary Camp Barangay.</p>

						<p>	However, in response to a petition from the Barangay Council, the City passed an Ordinance Numbered 62, Series of 1987 renaming West Bayan Park Barangay back to Leonila Hill 
							Barangay.</p>
							
						<p>	Officially, Leonila Hill Subdivision was a vacation place by the original homeowners from Manila. The proximity of the subdivision to the City Proper made it deal for vacation 
							homes, considering that, it is not far from the Central Business area. The surrounding hills that are stll lush and verdant that provides clean environment and nice view.</p>
							
						<p>	As the years went by, homeowners sold their houses to individuals who decided to settle for good.</p>
